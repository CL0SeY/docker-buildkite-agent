# buildkite-agent

Docker images for the [Buildkite Agent](https://github.com/buildkite/agent). There is a minimal Alpine Linux based image suitable for running Docker-based builds, and a larger Ubuntu based image.

Supported tags:

* `latest` ([Dockerfile](Dockerfile)) - Alpine Linux
* `ubuntu` ([ubuntu/Dockerfile](ubuntu/Dockerfile)) - Ubuntu

## Alpine Linux

This image is based on Alpine Linux and includes git and Docker Compose. Its minimal footprint and small size makes it ideal for running agents that do Docker-based builds.

```bash
docker run -it -e BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN=xxx buildkite/agent
```

## Ubuntu

This image is based on Ubuntu 14.04 and includes git and Docker Compose.

```bash
docker run -it -e BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN=xxx buildkite/agent:ubuntu
```

## Adding Hooks

To add custom hooks you can extend the image and copy the hooks into the correct hooks directory:

```docker
FROM buildkite/agent

Add hooks /buildkite/hooks/
```

## Docker-based Builds

If you want each build to be isolated within its own Docker container youâ€™ll need to make the Docker daemon and binary available inside the image. One way to do this is by linking them in directly like so:

```bash
docker run -it \
           -e BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN=xxx \
           -v `which docker`:/usr/bin/docker \
           -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
           buildkite/agent
```
